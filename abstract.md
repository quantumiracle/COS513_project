The project investigates the latent dynamics identification with observed trajectories based on variational inference methods. Previous works like Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF) [1], Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDS) [2] and Switching Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SNLDS) [3] have demonstrated the effectiveness on learning latent state transition for model-based reinforcement learning. We will investigate the methods based on vanilla auto-encoder or variational auto-encoder together with above methods for latent dynamics inference with simulated trajectories. Probabilistic representation of the latent variables will be applied for handling the uncertainty in dynamics inference with limited observations. Two approaches are investigated and compared in this project for latent dynamics inference: i). probabilistic approach using Bayesian neural networks and stochastic variational inference; 2). deterministic approach with SLDS model and linear approximation. Experiments on OpenAI gym inverted-doublependulum show that the probabilistic approach outperforms the SLDS method for embedding system identification, and both are more accurate than directly inferring the original dynamics parameters.
